# AdversarialProject
For semantic collisions:
need to have:
- collisions/collisions/birch/models/msmarco_mb/ with the model in it
- collisions/collisions/wiki103/bert/ with the model in it
- qrels.dev.tsv
- top1000.dev
- top1000_copy.dev (literally a copy)
need to do:
- run notebook.ipynb
- run semantic_collisions.py :)
